Well ,this workshop was a quick revision of all the previous workshops along with new feature of derived classes. All the other things were similar to previous one's like copy constructor, overloading and other things making my grip more tighter on these concepts, however, the derived classes were new thing for me. It took me a while to learn how it works and understand
the real meaning and purpose of overloading constructors in derived class. I learnt about virtual functions also from the notes which was not yet included in this workshop. Talking about
 the problems, initially, I had problem in defining the constructor for the derived class as there was no default constructor for the base class, so initiallising the derived class only 
with paramaterised constructor that calls the paramaterised constructor of the base class was difficult and tricky for me, however, after learnig about it from the notes, internet and 
getting help from videos, I was capable to understand the thing and make the constructor work in the desired way. Obviously, i faced some errors in the starting but was  successful at
 the end.
In the end, i would say it was quit tricky but was actually interseting and mindfull to do.
